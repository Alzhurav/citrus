== Schema validation

When structured data is transmitted from one system to another, it's important that the sender and the receiver
understand each other. To ensure this, a contract is required introducing the rules of communication for both parties.
This is mostly done by using schemas. Citrus brings the schema based validation of messages directly to your integration
test environment. This includes the management, mapping and filtering of schemas in context to your current test case
by just defining some rules in XML configuration or Java DSL. Let's start with this chapter by introducing some basic
concepts for the schema validation.
