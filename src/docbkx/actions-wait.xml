    <title>Wait</title>

    <para>With this action you can make your test wait until a certain condition is satisfied. The attribute
      <emphasis>seconds</emphasis> defines the amount of time to wait in seconds. You can also use the milliseconds attribute for a more
      fine grained time value. The attribute <emphasis>interval</emphasis> defines the amount of time to
      wait <emphasis>between</emphasis> each check. The interval is always specified as millisecond time interval.</para>

    <para>If the check does not exceed within the defined overall waiting time then the test execution fails
      with an appropriate error message. There are different types of conditions to check.</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para><emphasis>http</emphasis>: This condition is based on a Http request call on a server endpoint. Citrus will wait until the Http
      response is as defined (e.g. Http 200 OK). This is useful when you want a server to start up.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><emphasis>file</emphasis>: This condition checks for the existence of a file on the local file system. Citrus will wait until the file
      is present.</para></listitem>

    <para>When should somebody use this action? This action is very useful when you want your test to wait for a certain
      event to occur before continuing with the test execution. For example if you wish that your test waits until a Docker
      container is started or for an application to create a log file before continuing, then use this action. You can
      also create your own condition statements and bind it to the test action.
