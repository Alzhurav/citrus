  <title>What's new in Citrus 2.4?!</title>

  <para>Citrus 2.4 comes with a set of new features especially regarding Apache Camel and Docker integrations. Bugfixes of course are also part of the package. See the following overview on what has changed.</para>

  <section id="new-2-4-docker">
    <title>Docker support</title>

    <para>Docker and Microservices are frequent topics in software development recently. We have added interaction with Docker in Citrus so the user can manage Docker containers within a test case. Citrus now provides special Docker test actions for
      building, starting, stopping and inspecting Docker images and containers in a test. See <xref linkend="docker"/> for details.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="new-2-4-camel">
    <title>Camel actions</title>

    <para>Citrus has already had support for Apache Camel routes and Camel context loading. Now with 2.4 version we have added some special Apache Camel test actions for interacting with a Camel context and its routes.
    This enables the tester to create and use a new Camel route on the fly inside a test case. Also Citrus is now able to interact with the Camel control bus accessing route statistics and status information. Also possible are start, stop, suspend, resume operations
    on a Camel route. See <xref linkend="camel-actions"/> and <xref linkend="camel-controlbus"/> for details.</para>
