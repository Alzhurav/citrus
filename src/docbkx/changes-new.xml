  <title>What's new in Citrus 2.5?!</title>

  <para>We have added lots of new features and improvements with Citrus 2.5. Namely these are the new modules for RMI and JMX support, a new x-www-form-urlencoded message validator and new functions anc test actions.
  Just have a look at the following features that made it to the box.</para>

  <section id="new-2-5-rmi">
    <title>RMI support</title>

    <para>Remote method invocation is a standard Java technology and API for calling methods on remote objects across different JVM instances. Although RMI has lost its popularity it is still used in legacy components. Testing
    RMI bean invocation is a hard thing to do. Now Citrus provides client and server support for remote interface invocation. See <xref linkend="rmi"/> for details.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="new-2-5-jmx">
    <title>JMX support</title>

    <para>Similar to RMI JMX can be used to connect to remote bean invocation. This time we expose some beans to a managed bean server in order to be managed by JMX operations for read and write.
    With Citrus 2.5 we have added a client and server support for calling and providing managed beans on a mbean server. See <xref linkend="jmx"/> for details.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="new-2-5-form-urlencoded">
    <title>Http x-www-form-urlencoded message validator</title>

    <para>HTML form data can be transmitted with different methods and content types. One of the most common ways is to use <emphasis>x-www-form-urlencoded</emphasis> form data
    content. As validation can be tricky we have added a special message validator for that. See <xref linkend="http-www-form-urlencoded"/> for details.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="new-2-5-date-range">
    <title>Date range validation matcher</title>

    <para>Added a new validation matcher implementation that is able to check that a date value is between a certain date range (from and to) The date range is able to focus on days as well as additional time (hour, minute, second) specifications.
    See <xref linkend="validation-matcher-daterange"/> for details.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="new-2-5-file-resource">
    <title>Read file resource function</title>

    <para>A new function implementation offers you the possibilities to read file resource contents as inline data. The function is called and returns the file content as return value. The file content is then placed right where the function was called e.g. inside
    of a message paylaod element or as message header value. See <xref linkend="functions-read-file"/> for details.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="new-2-5-timer">
    <title>Timer container</title>

    <para>The new timer test action container repeats its execution based on a time expression (e.g. every 5 seconds). With this timer we can repeat test actions with a fixed time delay or constantly execute test actions with time schedule.
    See <xref linkend="containers-timer"/> and <xref linkend="actions-stop-timer"/> for details.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="new-2-5-vertx">
    <title>Upgrade to Vert.x 3.2.0</title>

    <para>The Vert.x module was upgraded to use Vert.x 3.2.0 version. The Citrus module implementation was updated to work with this new Vert.x version.
    Learn more about the Vert.x integration in Citrus with <xref linkend="vertx"/>.</para>
