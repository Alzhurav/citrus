  <title>What's new in Citrus 2.6?!</title>

  <para>Citrus 2.5 comes with a set of new modules that enable completely new aspects of integration testing. Namely these are the new modules for Cucumber behavior driven development and Zookeeper support.
  Just have a look at the following features that are shipped within the 2.6 box.</para>

  <section id="new-2-6-cucumber">
    <title>Cucumber BDD support</title>

    <para>Behavior driven development is more and more coming up also in the integration testing environment. Cucumber is a fantastic behavior driven development library that provides support for BDD concepts with Gherkin. The
      new Citrus integration with Cucumber enables the mix of Gherkin syntax feature scenarios with Citrus test case execution. You write feature stories as usual and create Citrus test cases with lots of actions for the integration
      test. See details for this feature in <xref linkend="cucumber"/>.</para>
